## Introduction

Tripify is a travel agency that aims to provide the best travel experience to its customers. In order to achieve this goal, the company is embarking on a digital transformation journey to modernize its booking and reservation processes. Tripify will generate sales and will provide business insights to the owners.

## Motivation

Tripify, the flight booking application, soars above the competition with an Express-backed backend that holds the key to efficient querying for generating invaluable sales data and illuminating business insights. In this repository, the database choice, meticulous data modeling, API design, authentication, and authorization mechanisms come together to form a symphony of functionality. Here, data ingestion from external sources, query optimization, analytics generation, and data visualization seamlessly blend to create a holistic solution that not only books flights but also enlightens businesses with actionable intelligence.
